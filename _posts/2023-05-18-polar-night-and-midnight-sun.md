If you now understand about Polar Night, Midnight is opposite of Polar Night. Midnight refers to an extended period of daytime that lasts 24 hours or more.

In summer, Article Circle gets direct sunlight 24 hours from Sun because of Earth's position and rotates on a titled axis of around 23.5 degrees. See in above photo. So, that occurs Midnight Sun also know as Polar Day in summer in North Pole. In the other hand, Anterctic Circle has no Sunlight in that time.
