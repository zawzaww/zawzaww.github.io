title: Started Using Twitter and Moved On
author: Zaw Zaw

I've decided to move completely to Twitter from Facebook and deleted permanently my Facebook account.
After 30 days, my Facebook account will be delete permanently.

I will support Spring Revolution and tweet about news and tech articles on Twitter.
And, I will support nearest CDMers every month with my few salary in real life.
I will start using Twitter only as daily use social media platform, instead of using Facbook for both Spring Revolution and Technology.

I will find and follow you (friends from Facebook) on Twitter.
Please, follow me on Twitter. I will follow you back.
