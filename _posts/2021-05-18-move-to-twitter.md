I've decided to move completely to Twitter from Facebook and deleted my Facebook account. After 30 days, my Facebook account will be delete permanently.

I will support spring revolution and tweet about news on Twitter. And, I support nearest CDMers every month with my few salary in real life. I will start using Twitter only as daily use social media platform for both spring revolution and technology.

I will find and follow you (friends from Facebook) on Twitter. Please, follow me on Twitter. I will follow back.
