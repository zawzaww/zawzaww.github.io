I've decided to move completely to Twitter. Now, I'm going to delete my Facebook account permanently. After 30 days, my Facebook account will be delete. I will start doing it tomorrow.

I will support spring revolution and tweet about news on Twitter. And, I support nearest CDMers every month with my few salary in real life. I will start using Twitter only as daily use social media platform for both spring revolution and technology.

I will find and follow you (friends from Facebook) on Twitter. Please, follow me on Twitter. I will follow back.
