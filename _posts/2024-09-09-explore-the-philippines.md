In this blog post, I will share all about the Philippines, my travel experience to Iloilo City, my favourite things, and photographs of Iloilo City. I've decided to go to the Philippines for remote work due to my home country's political situation. On April 24, 2024, I arrived in Iloilo City, Philippines. I just visited the famous places in Iloilo City, and currently, I'm working remotely from the Philippines.

## Introduction to the Philippines

The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia located in the Pacific Ocean near the equator. The Philippines takes its name from Philip II, who was king of Spain. The country was under Spanish rule for 333 years and under American colonialization for another 48 years. Manila is the capital city of the Philippines, but Quezon City is the country's most populous city. The Philippines is an archipelago, also known as an island group, that comprises 7,641 islands. It's the fifth-largest island country in the world.

 - **Visayas** The central region, Visayas, is a complex group of islands that includes the most well-known islands like Cebu, Bohol, Negros and Panay. Iloilo City is located in Western Visayas, Panay island.

 - **Mindanao** The southernmost region, Mindanao, is the second largest group of islands in the Philippines, which includes Tawi-Tawi, Basilan, and Sulu.

## Visa for Myanmar Nationals

For the Visa information, I've asked [Shwaid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-shwaid-ismael-73b57472), a Filipino who is currently working as General Counsel at Frontiir, how to get and extend the 9(a) Temporary Visitor Visa in the Philippines. Here is the information based on an email about the 9(a) Temporary Visitor Visa in the Philippines that Shwaid sent to me.

Myanmar (MM) citizens may enter the Philippines (PH) without a visa since MM is a member of the ASEAN. They will be considered on 9(a) Temporary Visitor Visa. They are allowed to enter the PH and can stay:

 - (a) For an initial period of 30 days from the date of arrival under the Visa-Free Stay Program (Executive Order No. 408);
 - (b) Extend his/her stay before the expiration of the visa-free stay by filing a visa-waiver application (with the PH Bureau of Immigration), which effectively extends the valid stay by a maximum of 2 months from the expiration of the 30-day visa-free stay;
 - (c) Further extend his/her valid stay prior to the expiration of the extend visa-waiver period by filing a tourist visa extension application (with the PH Bureau of Immigration). The extension can be from 2 to 6 six months; and
 - (d) Further extend by up to 6 months by filing a subsequent tourist visa extension application with the PH Bureau of Immigration.

Please note that a foreign national is only allowed a maximum valid stay of 2 continuous years counted from the date of arrival. Of course, a refresh period of two years kicks in upon his re-entry into the PH.

During his/her entire stay in the Philippines, the foreign national cannot seek gainful employment in a company that is doing business in the country.

 - [https://immigration.gov.ph/visas](https://immigration.gov.ph/visas)
 - [https://immigration.gov.ph/visa-waiver](https://immigration.gov.ph/visa-waiver)

The following Visa extension fees are based on my experience and recently extended Visa fees. To extend 9(a) Temporary Visitor Visa, need to go to the main [Bureau of Immigration (BI)](https://immigration.gov.ph) office or any Bureau of Immigration branch office. Make sure you bring your passport and then, fill out the application form and submit it. Please, also note that they only accept cash payments.

| Type of 9(a) Temporary Visitor Visa Task  | Deposit Required (PHP) |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 29-day Extension after initial stay       | ₱3000                  |
| 2-Month Extension after 59-day stay (A)   | ₱8000                  |
| 2-Month Extension after 2-month Ext (A)   | ₱2000                  |


## Flights

![img-iloilo-int-airport](/assets/images/featured-images/img_iloilo_int_airport.jpg)
_Photo: Iloilo International Airport by Zaw Zaw_

**Routes:** **Yangon (MM)** --> **Bangkok (THI)** --> **Manila (PH)** --> **Iloilo (PH)**

I've decided to go to Iloilo City because I think it's one of the most affordable cities in the Philippines. For the flight ticket, I've booked it through [Myanmar Signature Travels & Tours](http://www.myanmarsignaturetravel.com). It costs around 180,0000 MMK.

Here is detailed information on flights, routes, departures and arrival times.

| DATE           | FROM    | TO      | FLIGHT  | DEPARTURE TIME | ARRIVAL TIME    |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| April 26, 2024 | Yangon  | Bangkok | TG 304  | 07:00 PM (MMT)  | 09:00 PM (MMT) |
| April 26, 2024 | Bangkok | Manila  | PR 733  | 10:55 PM (MMT)  | 03:15 AM (MMT) |
| April 27, 2024 | Manila  | Iloilo  | PR 2141 | 08:20 AM (MMT)  | 09:35 AM (MMT) |

On April 26, 2024, at 7:00 PM, I departed from Yangon International Airport and arrived at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi International Airport at 9:00 PM.

Then, I continued to do the airport process, find the target terminal and get a boarding pass. And, around 11:00 PM, I departed from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi International Airport, and I arrived at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, also known as Manila International Airport, on April 27, 2024 at 3:00 AM.

Then, I continued to do the same airport process to get a boarding pass. At 8:30 AM, I departed from Manila International Airport, and I arrived at Iloilo International Airport on April 27, 2024, at 9:30 AM. Then, I go to the rental place by taxi from Iloilo International Airport.

## Renting House

![img-airbnb-house-renting](/assets/images/featured-images/img_airbnb_house_renting.png)

For renting a house, I've used the [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) website. It's like an agent and very helpful for tourists. Before I went to Iloilo City, I booked a shared room through the Airbnb website.

Firstly, you need to sign up an account on the Airbnb website.

Website: [https://www.airbnb.com](https://www.airbnb.com)

![image-airbnb-howto-rent](/assets/images/featured-images/img_airbnb_howto_rent.png)

Then, go to the home page and search for your destination, for example, **Iloilo, Western Visayas**. Then, select **check-in** and **check-out** dates, and add the number of guests. Then, select the rental place you want.

Then, you can book, make an online payment using a Credit or Visa card, and then contact and communicate with your host via message on the Airbnb website.

## Official Currency
### The Philippine Peso (PHP)

![img-philippine-peso](/assets/images/featured-images/img_philippine_peso.jpg)

The Philippine Peso, PHP, as symbol ₱, is official currency in the Philippines. It's also called Piso in Filipino.

**Philippine Peso (PHP) Profile**

| **ISO Code**     | PHP |
| **Symbol**       | ₱ |
| **Central Bank** | Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas |
| **Banknotes**    | ₱20, ₱50, ₱100, ₱200, ₱500, ₱1000 |
| **Coins**        | ₱1, ₱5, ₱10, ₱20 |
| **User(s)**      | Philippines |

The official website of Central Bank Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas: [https://www.bsp.gov.ph](https://www.bsp.gov.ph)

In the Philippines, both **Coins** and **Banknotes** are used. I've noticed that PHP ₱1, ₱5, ₱10, and ₱20 are available as coins and PHP ₱20, ₱50, ₱100, ₱200, ₱500, and ₱1000 are available as banknotes. PHP ₱20 is available in both coins and banknotes.

## Foreign Exchange Rate

The following foreign exchange rate as of **August 30, 2024**. This may change and please, see up-to-date information on the official website of Central Bank of the Philippines, [https://www.bsp.gov.ph/SitePages/Statistics/exchangerate.aspx](https://www.bsp.gov.ph/SitePages/Statistics/exchangerate.aspx) and the official website of Metrobank, [https://www.metrobank.com.ph/articles/forex](https://www.metrobank.com.ph/articles/forex)

![img-php-exchange-rate](/assets/images/featured-images/img_php_exchange_rate.png)

For **Myanmar Kyat (MMK)**, the Central Bank of the Philippines has not described the official exchange rate on the website. The following exchange rate is based on my experience and AYA Bank's transaction logs.

Please, also note that this MMK exchange rate as of **August 25, 2024** and this may change depending on the MMK value.

| MMK Exchange Rate | PHP ₱1 | = MMK 62 |

## Using an AYA Visa Prepaid Card
#### [https://www.ayabank.com/digital-services/card-services/prepaid-card](https://www.ayabank.com/digital-services/card-services/prepaid-card)

![img-aya-visa-prepaid-card](/assets/images/featured-images/img_aya_visa_prepaid_card.png)

I've applied for an AYA Visa prepaid card at AYA Bank before I went to Iloilo City, Philippines. Currently, I'm using this Visa card for cash withdrawals and making online payments.

Here is the detailed information on fees and charges. Please, see up-to-date information on [https://www.ayabank.com/digital-services/card-services/prepaid-card](https://www.ayabank.com/digital-services/card-services/prepaid-card).

| **Annual Fee** | Free |
| **Card Fees** | 10,000 MMK |
| **Card Lost/Damage/Reissue Fees** | 10,000 MMK |
| **Cash Top up and Account Transfer (MMK)** | 2,000 MMK |
| **PIN Reissue Fees** | 1,000 MMK |
| **Balance Inquiry** | Free |
| **Statement Request fee** | Free |
| **ATM Withdrawal Fees** | Withdrawal Fee: 10% + Oversea Bank Charges (Per Transaction) |
| **International Transaction Fees** | Fees: 18% to 30%, Currency Conversion Fees: 15% to 50%, Mark Up: 15% to 50% |

I've mentioned above that I'm currently using this Visa card for cash withdrawals. But, I was faced with the issue that AYA Bank only allowed foreign currency equivalent to MMK 500,000 per month to withdraw cash at the ATM machine. Please, also note that you need to pay 10% + oversea bank charges PHP 250 for cash withdrawals.

For example,

I've withdrew cash of MMK 400,000 at the ATM machine, and then I paid around MMK 800,00 for AYA Bank's charges of 10% + oversea bank charges.

I also noticed that international transaction fees are around 18% to 30%.

For example,

| An Umbrella = PHP 499 | + PHP 100 (charges) | Total cost = PHP 599 |

I bought an umbrella at the SM store in Iloilo City that costs PHP 499, and I paid for it with my AYA Visa prepaid card. Then, I calculated and checked the balance and it actually costs around PHP 599.

To check the balance of an AYA Visa prepaid card, you can use the AYA mobile banking app or the AYA Pay app. You can also request your card balance and statement by sending an email to [support.card@ayabank.com](mailto:support.card@ayabank.com).

## Using PayPal Service

![img-paypal-philippines](/assets/images/featured-images/img_paypal_ph.png)

PayPal service is officially available in the Philippines. I'm now using it as a payment option. But, currently, the **Add Money from a Bank account and Debit or Credit card** service is not available in the Philippines.

I tried to link my AYA and YOMA bank accounts in PayPal. It did not work. But, I linked my AYA Visa Prepaid card and sending payments with this Visa card worked properly.

Here is PayPal's service fee based on my experience. I sent money of PHP ₱3,000.00 to my host via PayPal using the Visa card payment option and the service fee is around PHP ₱117.00.

![img-paypal-service-fee](/assets/images/featured-images/img_paypal_service_fee.png)

## SIM Card Registration
#### [https://smart.com.ph](https://smart.com.ph)

![img-smart-esim](/assets/images/featured-images/img_smart_esim.png)

I've decided to buy the Smart prepaid eSIM because it's easy to buy and my Google Pixel 4a phone has supported eSIM feature and currently, I'm using it. Basically, Smart prepaid eSIM is a digital version of a physical SIM embedded inside an eSIM-capable phone. Simply scan the eSIM QR sent to your email and register at [https://simreg.smart.com.ph](https://simreg.smart.com.ph) to activate.

Buy Smart Prepaid eSIM at [https://store1.smart.com.ph/view/2661](https://store1.smart.com.ph/view/2661).

Firstly, I've bought this Smart prepaid eSIM via the official website with AYA Visa card that costs only **PHP ₱99**, and then I've received the eSIM QR code via email from Smart. Then, I scanned this Smart eSIM QR code and downloaded it on my Android phone, Google Pixel 4a. It worked properly.

**NOTE:** It depends on Android device manufacturers and Android version.

For example, on the Google Pixel 4a Android phone,

**Settings --> Network & internet --> SIMs --> Add eSIM --> Scan the QR code --> Download the Smart eSIM**

Then, you will see the downloaded Smart eSIM in SIMs settings.

![img-android-esim-smart](/assets/images/screenshots/img_screenshot_esim_smart.png){: width="350" .normal }

Then, I've registered the Smart eSIM via the Smart SIM registration website [https://simreg.smart.com.ph](https://simreg.smart.com.ph) and followed the instructions to register the Smart eSIM in simple 3 steps.

![img-smart-sim-registration](/assets/images/featured-images/img_smart_sim_registration.png)

## Official Languages

![img-official-languages](/assets/images/featured-images/img_languages_ph.png)

In the Philippines, both Filipino and English are official languages. Actually, the Philippines has 135 to 195 spoken languages. But, it depends on regions and islands. Please, see the above photo. But, as main languages, people of the Philippines speak Filipino or Tagalog, and English.

In Iloilo City, most of the people speak Filipino, a national language, and a standardized variety of Tagalog and English as a second language. I met most Filipinos in Iloilo City. Based on my experience, 90% of Filipinos speak English. But, mostly, locals speak Tagalog or Filipino to communicate with each other.

## Public Transportation

![img-public-transport-jeepney](/assets/images/featured-images/img_pub_transport_jeepney.jpg)
_Photo: A Jeepney by Zaw Zaw_

In Iloilo City, Philippines, Jeepneys and Minibuses are mainly used as public transportation. But, as I mentioned in the "Fascinating facts about the Philippines" section, Jeepneys are popular and the usual public transportation. It's colorful, a symbol of Filipino culture and a unique public transportation system in the Philippines.

Another popular mode of public transportation in the Philippines is motorized tricycles, especially common in small urban and rural areas.
