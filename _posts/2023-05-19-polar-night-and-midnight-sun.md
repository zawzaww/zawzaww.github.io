In this blog post, I will share how Earth orbits the Sun and interesting facts about Sun and Earth.
I explored and realized why some Nordic countries (For example: Finland, Sweden and Norway) have Polar Night in winter and Midnight Sun in summer.

- **Polar Night**: Polar Night is an extended period of night time that lasts 24 hours or more.
- **Midnight Sun**: Midnight is an extended period of day time that lasts 24 hours or more.

## Why does Polar Night occur?

Firstly, we need to understand how Earth orbits the Sun. The Earth orbits around the Sun every 365.25 days and Earth also rotating on it's own axis.

The Earth rotates on a tilted axis of around 23.5 degrees. See in above photo. Polar Night refers to an extended period of night time that lasts 24 hours or more. In Winter, Arctic Circle region has no sunlight because of Earth's position and is tilted on it's axis by 23.5 degrees. So, that occurs 24 hours night in countries such as Finland, Sweden Norway and etc...

## Why does Midnight Sun occur?

If you now understand about Polar Night, Midnight Sun is opposite of Polar Night. Midnight Sun refers to an extended period of daytime that lasts 24 hours or more.

In Summer, the North Pole stays in full sunlight 24 hours also known as Sun never sets in Arctic Circle region because of Earth's position and rotates on a tilted axis of around 23.5 degrees. See in above photo. So, that occurs Midnight Sun also know as Polar Day during the Summer in Arctic Circle region. In the other hand, Anterctic Circle has no Sunlight in that time.
