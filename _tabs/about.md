Formerly, Recognized Developer and Contributor at [@XDA-Developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/) Forums. I've contributed to Android, Linux kernel and  Android open source project, AOSP based Android custom firmware projects on XDA Android Forums.

I've always loved working with Low-level software and command-line tools to interact with hardware. Currently, I'm working on Linux, CI/CD, Docker containers and Kubernetes. I've always had a keen interest in Computer hardware/software, Operating systems, Unix/Linux systems programming, Linux kernel hacking, Cloud computing and containers. And, I also love to take photograph and interested in nature photography.
