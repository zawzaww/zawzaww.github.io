Systems Programmer/SRE Engineer, focusing on Linux and Containers

Currently, I'm a SRE engineer at [@Frontiir](http://www.frontiir.com/), working on RnD/DevSA, systems automation team. Formerly, Recognized Developer/Contributor at [@XDA-Developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/) Forums. I've contributed to Android, Linux kernel and  Android open source project, AOSP based Android custom firmware projects on XDA Forums.

I've always loved working with Low-level software and command-line tools on Linux to communicate and interact with hardware. Currently, I'm working on Linux, CI/CD, Kubernetes and Docker containers. I've always had a keen interest in Computer hardware/software, Unix/Linux systems programming, Linux kernel hacking, Cloud computing and containers. And, I also love to take photograph and interested in nature photography.
