![About Me](https://i.postimg.cc/GtmcpymP/zawzaw-round-img.png){: width="250" height="250" .normal}

I'm Zaw Zaw from [Pyay, Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyay). Full name is Zaw Zaw Thein. I'm publishing articles that focus on Linux, Containerization, CI/CD tools, Cloud-native technologies, Kubernetes, and much more on the blog. I was born and grew up in [Pyay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyay), also known as [Pyu Ancient City, Sri Ksetra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyu_city-states#Sri_Ksetra).

I'm an SRE Engineer and Former Recognized Developer (RD) at [@XDA-Developers Forums](https://forum.xda-developers.com). I've previously contributed to the Android operating system, Linux kernel, and Android Open Source Project (AOSP) based Android custom firmware projects on XDA Android Forums. I've loved working with Low-level software and Systems programming. Currently, I'm working on Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), Linux, Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment and Delivery (CD) tools, Containerization, and the Kubernetes platform.

I've always had a keen interest in Computer engineering, Systems programming, Operating systems, Linux kernel, Cloud computing, Containerization, Cloud-native technologies and Kubernetes. And I also love to take photographs and am interested in photography.
